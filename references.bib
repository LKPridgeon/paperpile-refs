  publisher = "John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd",
  address   = "Chichester, UK",
  pages     = "387--394",
  abstract  = "There is a long tradition of historical analysis that examines
               the production of maps, their development over time and their
               role in society. Such analysis implicitly concerns the power of
               mapping to influence social and economic relations in particular
               places and times.More recently, research has focused specifically
               on the politics and power of mapping; how power is captured in
               and communicated through maps to assert command and control of
               territory and socio-spatial relations; how power is bound up in
               the very creation and use of maps; and how mapping practices are
               used to resist and contest the exercise of power over space.Much
               of this research is framed within what has been termed critical
               cartography (Harley 1989; Crampton and Krygier 2005) and critical
               GIS (Pickles 1995; Curry 1998; Schuurman 1999; O’Sullivan 2006).
               Critical cartography is post-positivist in its approach, drawing
               on a range of social theory to re-examine cartographic
               representations and the wider milieu of mapping processes. It is
               often avowedly political in its analysis of mapping praxis,
               seeking to deconstruct the work of maps and the science that
               produces them, often undertaking to produce alternative maps that
               are sensitive to the power relations at play. On the one hand,
               this has led to an examination of the power of maps and the work
               they do in the world, and on the other to new forms of
               collaborative and counter-mapping that seek to produce empowering
               and emancipatory cartographies, which subvert the status quo. In
               both cases, there is an explicit recognition that maps are a
               product of power at work and that they are powerful tools in
               struggles of domination and resistance. In this section excerpts
               from a number of key readings that seek to document and theorize
               the power of maps are provided.",

  abstract  = "From the dawn of history the drama has been one of society's
               principal mechanisms for resolving social and psychological
               conflicts. Dramatic narrative straightens out and simplifies a
               confused situation; it purifies and channels the release of
               conflicting emotions. Drama addresses itself to three general
               types of conflicts: 1) conflicts between socioeconomic classes or
               political factions; 2) conflicts between the individual and
               society or god; 3) intrapsychic conflicts. Although ``theater for
               the elite,'' staged indoors and employing themes of interest only
               to the well-educated, may deal successfully with the second and
               third types of conflicts, a truly ``popular theater'' whose
               audience is comprised of all segments of the community has a more
               far-reaching practical effect in treating social or political
               conflicts. In England, the last great age of popular theater was
               the late Middle Ages. The mystery plays, vernacular presentations
               of the Biblical history of the world from the Creation to
               Doomsday, staged in the streets of scores of towns by members of
               the craft guilds, attracted large audiences from about 1350 until
               suppressed by the Reformation in about 1575 for political
               reasons. This universal popularity with all segments of the
               population over a period of two hundred years, without any change
               in the scripts, is unsurpassed by any other form of drama in
               English. The morality plays enjoyed a similar popularity from
               about 1400 to 1600. These moralities centered on the life of the
               individual Christian, portrayed as a generalized type-figure such
               as ``Mankind'' or ``Everyman,'' and emphasized his fall from
               grace, his death, and his eventual salvation through the
               intercession of a divine figure, usually Christ or the Virgin.
               Unlike the mystery plays, which employed amateurs and did not
               charge admission, the morality plays, were acted by troops of
               wandering professional players who performed in innyards or on
               specially-constructed outdoor stages before paying audiences of
               country people, sometimes running as large as four thousand
               (Southern, 1958, pp. 58-59). Both the mystery and morality plays
               are interesting vehicles for the solution of both social and
               intrapsychic conflicts among the uneducated or partially-educated
               bulk of the population.",

               literature has experienced a revolution, which has reinvigorated
               many parts of the discipline and changed the shape of the subject
               in relation to previous scholarship. ‘New’ texts (laws and
               penitentials, women's writing, drama records), innovative fields
               and objects of study (the history of the book, the study of space
               and the body, medieval masculinities), and original ways of
               studying them (the Sociology of the Text, performance studies)
               have emerged. This has brought fresh vigour and impetus to
               medieval studies, and has impacted significantly on cognate
               periods and areas. This book brings together the insights of
               these new fields and approaches with those of more familiar texts
               and methods of study, to provide a comprehensive overview of
               medieval literature. Topics covered range from the canonical
               genres of Saints' lives, sermons, romance, lyric poetry, and
               heroic poetry; major themes including monstrosity and
               marginality, patronage and literary politics, manuscript studies

               innovative method that bridges philosophy and biblical studies,
               he argues that much of the instruction within Proverbs meets the
               criteria for moral and theological virtue as set out in
               Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics and the works of St. Thomas
               Aquinas. Keefer presents the moral thought of Proverbs in its
               social, historical, and theological contexts. He shows how these
               contexts shed light on the conceptualization of virtue, the
               virtues that are promoted and omitted, and the characteristics
               that make Proverbs a distinctive moral tradition. In giving
               undivided attention to biblical virtue, this volume opens the way
               for new avenues of study in biblical ethics, including law,
               narrative, and other aspects of biblical instruction and wisdom.",

               costs of progress may help us to imagine alternatives to the
               corruption and oppressive conformity of modern society.

               metaphysics and epistemology, mind and emotion, morality and
               politics, history, economics, and religion. Although there is
               little debate about the importance and significance of Hume’s
               philosophical contributions, there is, nevertheless, considerable
               debate about the interpretation of his overall philosophical
               achievement as well as his particular aims and intentions with
               respect to the specific topics he addresses. Beyond this, there
               is also considerable disagreement about the critical assessment
               or plausibility of the various arguments and positions that Hume
               advances. This collection aims to provide a comprehensive set of
               analyses and assessments of the key components and aspects of
               Hume’s philosophical work. The contributions are drawn from among
               the leading figures of contemporary philosophy and Hume

               understanding of the core themes and features of Hume’s

  abstract  = "Abstract The last decade has seen a marked resurgence of interest
               in aesthetics and philosophy of art from those working outside
               these areas, and a reciprocal resurgence of interest in other
               areas of philosophy from philosophers of art. This volume
               represents an important step in the spirit of bringing these
               different fields together. The collection is the first of its
               kind. It contains twenty-one original essays by leading authors
               who examine questions at the intersection of art and philosophy.
               The essays draw meaningful connections between art and
               philosophy, using artworks to motivate, support, and shape their
               views. The authors also draw connections between the theoretical
               discipline of aesthetics and philosophy of art, on the one hand,
               and the rest of philosophy, on the other. Many of the chapters
               aim to teach us something about philosophical matters by
               examining art and other aesthetic objects, and many of them bring
               together contemporary thought and research in aesthetics and
               philosophy of art with important developments in other areas of
               philosophy. The topics range from metaphysics and philosophy of
               language to creativity and love, paving the way for students,
               teachers, and researchers to engage directly with the philosophy
               of art while simultaneously building bridges to and from other
               areas of philosophy. By placing the connection to art at the
               forefront, the volume is a testament to the myriad ways art and
               the philosophy of art intersect and overlap with issues that lie
               at the core of contemporary philosophy writ large.",

               like the invisible entrails of an elaborate plumbing system,
               philosophical ideas respond to basic needs that are fundamental
               to human life. Melioristic projects in philosophy attempt to fix
               or reroute this plumbing. An obstacle to melioristic projects is
               that the sheer familiarity of the underlying philosophical ideas
               renders the plumbing invisible. Philosophical genealogies aim to
               overcome this by looking at the origins of our current concepts.
               We discuss philosophical concepts developed in Indigenous
               cultures as a source of inspiration for melioristic genealogy.
               Examining the philosophical concepts of these communities is
               useful because it gives us a better idea of the range of ethical,
               political, and metaphysical approaches that exist in the world.
               Members of western societies do not get a clear view of this
               range, in part because living in large groups presents its own
               constraints and challenges, which limit philosophical options. We
               argue that features of Indigenous philosophies, such as
               egalitarianism and care for one's natural environment, are not
               inevitable byproducts of Native material conditions and
               lifestyles, but that they are deliberate forms of conceptual
               engineering. We propose that comparative philosophy is an
               integral part of the genealogical project.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Metaphysics has traditionally been characterized as
               aiming to discover highly general, basic, or fundamental facts
               about the world. But this way of thinking of metaphysics has
               become outdated and problematic. This chapter presents three
               central problems that arise for this conception of metaphysics,
               including a rivalry with science, proliferation of views in a way
               that leads to skepticism, and epistemological mystery. The
               chapter also prefigures the diagnosis of where various approaches
               to metaphysics go wrong: in assuming that all the types of
               discourse of interest in metaphysics function to track or
               describe features of the world. One goal of the book is to show
               how we can identify the different functions various areas of
               discourse serve, in ways that enable us to unravel old
               metaphysical problems. Another goal is to show how we can avoid
               problems with the traditional conception of metaphysics by
               reconceiving work in metaphysics as conceptual engineering.",

               festivity and politics and more particularly on the growing need
               for political authorities to control the urban environment. This
               article provides a longue durée approach to carnival in Venice
               and unpacks the meaning of its successive metamorphoses. During
               the Middle Ages, Venetians used carnival as a defense strategy
               for their city, intended to ensure the cohesion of its various
               neighborhoods around a common destiny. In the fifteenth century,
               the legacy of public festivals for both rich and poor gave way to
               a more official celebration, which allowed Venice to outdo its
               European rivals. The civilized and policed expressions that were
               elaborated from the Renaissance until the eighteenth century
               gradually set Venetian Carnival apart from the exuberance and
               invertibility displayed by rustic carnivals in other parts of
               Europe. However watered-down and commodified present-day Venetian
               Carnival may seem, it continues to raise eminently political
               issues, most of which have to do with the appropriation of public
               space by private interests and the recreation of traditions for
               mass consumption.",

  abstract  = "Despite the widespread use of humour in carnivals, research in
               this area is limited. Therefore, this research seeks to address
               this gap and uncover the humorous nature of carnivals from a
               scientific perspective. The purpose of this research is to
               conduct a scientific analysis of the humorous nature of carnival
               culture, to clarify its origins and impact on society. The
               following methods were used to achieve the research purpose:
               observation, interviews, questionnaires, statistical method, and
               content analysis method. The research established that carnival
               is a significant mechanism for expressing social, political and
               cultural problems of society. This event is a kind of forum where
               citizens have the opportunity to express their thoughts, feelings
               and opinions on various aspects of life. The research confirmed
               that humour at carnivals is an essential means of communication
               and expression. It can acquire different forms, such as satire,
               parody and irony. These types of humour are used to expose
               social, political and cultural aspects through using ridicule,
               distortion and transformation of reality. Carnival humour has the
               potential to highlight the severity of problems and highlight the
               shortcomings of society. The research makes a significant
               contribution to the scientific understanding of the humorous
               nature of carnival culture. The results of the research will
               contribute to a deeper analysis and testing of concepts related
               to the impact of carnival and humour on modern society",
